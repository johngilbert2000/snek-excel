# snek-in-excel
A snake game that runs in Microsoft Excel, written using VBA.

To begin, download the Snek3.0.xlsm file, open it in Microsoft Excel, and Enable Macros.

Click "New Game," and use the arrow keys to control the snake.

For best performance, press and hold the arrow key corresponding to the direction you want the snake to move.



Note: Some performance had to be sacrificed to allow this to work on all operating systems (Windows APIs were not used, and Excel VBA can only do one thing at a time without Windows APIs). 

As far as I can tell, Excel was not really designed for video games.
